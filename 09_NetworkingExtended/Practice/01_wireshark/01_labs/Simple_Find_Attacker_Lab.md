# Simple Lab

You have acquired a packet capture (PCAP) file showing network traffic between a newly infected victim computer and the attacker's listening post (LP). The LP is simply a server that is listening for incoming connections on a certain port.
 Review the “register.pcap” file and find the IP address of the attacker’s LP.

# the attacker ip: 172.28.28.194
# the attacker listening port: 9999
